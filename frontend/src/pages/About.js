        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p>Found in 2020, our company quickly became a leader of custom PC’s bulding market.
        We’re one and only CIS company, which can get any part of PC you want, from custom case or cooling to even custom GPU or backplates like V1 Tech.

Also we’re planning not only to build PC’s, but start creating out own SFF (Small Form Factor) PC cases in nearly future. Stay tuned!</p>
